This is my final-year undergraduate research project focused on utilizing Aspen Plus process simulation software to design a lithium bromide (LiBr) absorption chiller plant powered by boiler blowdown waste heat. After generating a dataset through simulation, I trained a machine learning model to predict key input parameters. I then developed a Django web application to allow users to interact with the model and test its functionality.

# Maximizing Waste Heat Recovery from Boiler Blowdown

This repository contains the code and resources for my final-year research project: **"Maximizing Waste Heat Recovery from Boiler Blowdown at Lakvijaya Power Plant with Aspen Plus for Enhanced Absorption Chiller Efficiency."**

## Project Highlights:
- **Aspen Plus Simulation:** Designed and simulated an absorption chiller system to optimize boiler blowdown waste heat recovery. Key components include:
  - Desorber
  - Evaporator
  - Expansion Valve
  - Pump
- **Dataset Creation:** Generated and processed simulation data, capturing variations in temperature, pressure, and flow rates for the absorption chiller system. Key metrics include Coefficient of Performance (COP) and Evaporator Duty.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trained predictive models to optimize system performance based on the dataset.
- **Django Web Application:** Developed a user-friendly web app for real-time performance calculations and system optimization using trained machine learning models.

## Features:
- Interactive interface for entering system parameters.
- Dynamic predictions and optimization results.
- Easily extendable architecture for additional parameters or system changes.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the README for deploying the Django app.
3. Use the web interface to simulate and calculate optimized system performance.
